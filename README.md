## Project Overview
The **Medical Chatbot** is designed to provide quick and accurate responses to users’ medical inquiries. It can assist users with general health advice, symptoms, preventive care, and more. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models, web deployment, and data integration to create a practical AI solution.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands user input and provides appropriate responses.
- **Medical Data Integration**: Uses predefined medical datasets for accurate responses.
- **Web-based Interface**: Accessible through a web application, allowing easy interaction.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be extended with additional medical topics or integrated with other systems.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Make sure Python is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git**: Used for cloning the repository. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Virtual Environment** (recommended): A virtual environment is highly recommended to manage dependencies.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Medical-Chatbot.git
   cd Medical-Chatbot
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   Create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - **MacOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   Use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Environment Setup

1. **Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to store environment-specific variables (such as API keys). Example:
   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

2. **Database Configuration** (if applicable)  
   If the project integrates a database, configure it in the `.env` file or set up according to the app's database setup instructions.

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**  
   Start the chatbot application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Access the Web Interface**  
   Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to interact with the chatbot.

3. **Chat with the Bot**  
   Begin asking questions related to health, symptoms, and general medical advice.

## Customization

1. **Modify Responses**
   Adjust responses in `src/` if you’d like to personalize the chatbot’s language or include more specific information.

2. **Change the Dataset**
   To update or replace the dataset, add new data files to the **data/** folder and ensure `app.py` or relevant scripts are updated to load the correct data.

3. **Update the Model**
   If you wish to train or use a different model, replace the files in the **model/** folder and adjust any code in **src/** that loads the model.

## Troubleshooting

- **Virtual Environment Issues**: If the virtual environment does not activate, try re-creating it or ensure you have the correct permissions.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date with all necessary packages, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if there are missing dependencies.
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check `.env` configurations if you encounter authentication or API issues.
